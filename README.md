Adventure
=========

Text-based adventure game written in Lua

How To Run Adventure
--------------------
1. Pull the repository to desktop using the GitHub for Windows tool.
2. Open the src folder and run the run.bat tool.

How To Create an Adventure
--------------------------
1. Add a new lua file to the data folder. Format it using viceroy.lua as an example and the following documentation.
2. Add the new adventure to config.lua. See the following documentation for details.
3. Test your adventure using the run.bat file.

Template adventure file
-----------------------
```
return {
    adventure = {
        id = "",
        name = "",
        description = "",
        author = "",
        date = "",
        notes = "",
        prereqs = {}
    },
    rooms = {
    },
    entities = {
        props = {
        },
        items = {
        }
    }
}
```

Data Format:
------------
- adventure (Table): Adventure specific data
- rooms (Table<Room>): A table of room definitions. The key is the ID for the room, and used to 
    reference the room in script.
- entities (Table): A table containing two subtables:
    - props (Table<Prop>): A table of prop definitions. The key is the ID for the prop, used in 
        room definitions and script.
    - items (Table<Item>): A table of item definitions. The key is the ID for the item, used in 
        room definitions and script.

Adventure Data Format:
----------------------
- id (String):            String identifier of the adventure. Used to switch adventures in script.
- name (String):          Human readable name of the adventure. Will display in the adventure list.
- description (String):   Human readable long description of the adventure. Will display when the 
    player gets more information about the adventure.
- start (String):         Human readable text to be displayed when the adventure first starts.
- author (String):        The in-canon name of the technician who created the level. I prefer the 
    format: "<Rank> <First Initial>. <Last Name>". I feel this should somewhat reflect the name of 
    the actual author of the adventure. For example, my name is Randy Knapp, and I game myself the 
    rank of Class-61 Technician (a tech who works on Mjolnir II armor) so my author entry is "C-61 
    Tech R. Knapp".
- date (String):          In-canon date when the level was created. 
- notes (String):         Human readable fluff text. This will be displayed along with the 
    description but with different formatting to show that it's fluff.
- prereqs (List<String>): A list of adventure ID strings that the player must complete before this 
    adventure becomes available. If this field is missing or is an empty table, then this adventure 
    will be available immediately.

** IMPORTANT ** 
    Be sure to add your new adventure to config.lua. See section below detailing the process.

    is the string to print when the player tries to move through this exit.

Adding your adventure to the game
---------------------------------
Be sure to add your new adventure to the adventures list in config.lua. Add the following line: 

    require 'data.<filename>',

to the list and it will become available from the hub. Note that the filename should not include 
".lua". For example, if your adventure was in viceroy.lua, you would put:

    require 'data.viceroy',

(with the trailing comma) into the list. The data list is in the order the adventures will appear 
when the player asks for available adventures in-game.
